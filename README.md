# PornographerWiki

The Pornographer Wiki is a for all those people who want to get into pornography and sex work. This could be from running their own site, being a cammer, escort, dancer, or just lovers of porn.

The site can be found at https://pornographer.wiki

It's a simple static site made using MKDocs and CloudFlare Pages. 

No ads, no tracking, none of that crap that makes the current web horrible. Just info on porn and sex work.
